        <ul>
            <li><h3>International Standard Serial Number (ISSN)</h3></li>
            An International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) is an eight-digit serial number used to uniquely identify a serial publication, such as a magazine.
            The ISSN is especially helpful in distinguishing between serials with the same title.
            ISSN are used in ordering, cataloging, interlibrary loans, and other practices in connection with serial literature.

            <li><h3>Global Trade Item Number (GTIN)</h3></li>
            The Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) is an identifier for trade items, developed by GS1. 
            Such identifiers are used to look up product information in a database (often by entering the number through a barcode scanner pointed at an actual product) which may belong to a retailer, manufacturer, collector, researcher, or other entity. 
            The uniqueness and universality of the identifier is useful in establishing which product in one database corresponds to which product in another database, especially across organizational boundaries.

            <li><h3>International Organization for Standardization (ISO)</h3></li>
            The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is an international standard-setting body composed of representatives from various national standards organizations.

            <li><h3>International Chemical Identifier (InChI)</h3></li>
            The IUPAC International Chemical Identifier (InChI) is a textual identifier for chemical substances, designed to provide a standard way to encode molecular information and to facilitate the search for such information in databases and on the web. 

            <li><h3>Serial number</h3></li>
            A serial number is a unique identifier assigned incrementally or sequentially to an item, to uniquely identify it.
